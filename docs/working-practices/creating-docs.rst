Creating documentation
######################

For writing guides and manuals, we are using
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ which is a Python package.

    `Click here for tips on getting started with Sphinx <../developer/developer_tools/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_

`Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_ will be used for automatically
generating documentation describing our code, such as inheritance diagrams, man
pages and call trees.

We have created a GitHub repository for holding documentation called JCSDA/jedi-docs.
Please place your documentation in this repository and place the appropriate links and text
to your documentation in the top level index.html file.

SABER is the **System Agnostic Background Error Representation**.

It provides generic software utilities for computing and working with the background error covariance matrix, often referred to as the **B** matrix.  It includes the Background error on an Unstructured Mesh Package (BUMP) that can be used to compute the **B** matrix from ensembles on any grid.  BUMP can also accommodate static and hybrid approaches for the **B** Matrix.

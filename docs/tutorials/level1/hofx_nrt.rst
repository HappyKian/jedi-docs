Tutorial: Simulating Observations with UFO
==========================================

Learning Goals:
 - Create simulated observations similar to those highlighted on `JCSDA's Near Real-Time Observation Modeling web site <http://nrt.jcsda.org>`_
 - Introduce yourself to the rich variety of observation operators now available in :doc:`UFO <../../jedi-components/ufo/index>`

Prerequisites:
 - Either :doc:`Run JEDI in a Container <run-jedi>` or :doc:`Building and Testing FV3 Bundle <dev-container>`

Overview
--------

In the :doc:`Run JEDI in a Container <run-jedi>` tutorial we used a version of an :doc:`application container <../../developer/jedi_environment/portability>`.  This means that the container includes the compiled source code, ready to use.  The ``jedi-tutorial`` container comes pre-packaged with JEDI!
